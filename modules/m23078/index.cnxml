        <para id="id2875424">The adventures of the Wops family are closely related to the experience of every learner in Grade I, boys as well as girls. They may be exposed to a different environment if they live in towns and cities and through the stories become aware of what it is like to live in a forest without the ordinary amenities like running water and electricity.</para>
        <para id="id7758476">Educators need to remember that many learners in Grade I will not have attended Grade R and consequently skills, strategies and concepts for Grade R will not have been learnt. The educator in Grade I must ensure that these are covered in the work that is done with these learners.</para>
        <para id="id4113077">Listening and speaking should form a firm foundation on which to build literacy. The degree to which learners can speak their home language will vary according to circumstances, and educators should be aware of their levels of competence.</para>
        <para id="id4348679">Language development is a gradual process and learners need the support of the educator to become increasingly more accurate in the use of their home language.</para>
        <para id="id2362553">In Grade I learners become involved in listening to and reading stories, writing for genuine purposes, and learning phonics. The classroom environment should be a place that reflects and encourages all aspects of learning the home language.</para>
        <para id="id3021744">Time scheduled for the modules 1 to 8</para>
        <para id="id3290083">All learners should complete all eight modules doing approximately two modules per term. Allow the learners to proceed at their own speed.</para>
